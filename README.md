www.2055project.website is accumulatory, parasitic, and at times, haphazard. It will be under continous construction for the duration of its exhibition time, from September 25th 2015 until April 30th 2016. It takes its content from that which has been generated by the artists and curators of Unit/Pitt and reformats it. Remediates it.

www.2055project.website is an online exhibition space. It embraces the platform and architecture of the internet and the ways in which this has reconstituted the possibilities for exhibiting and viewing artworks. We might ask: to what extent is the teleology of artistic production influenced by its inevitable digitization?
